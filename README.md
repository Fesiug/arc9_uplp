# PolyArms Project
The PolyArms Project (will be named like this if i won't find any better name until release)

Very WIP!!! 

Includes 9 weapons at the moment:
- AK (Default build is AK-103) - Can be made into almost any AK
- AK-12 (AK-12M1 2023) - can be made into ak12/15/19/308/rpk16 from 2016 to 2023
- AK SMG (PP-19-01 "Vityaz") - can be made into bizon/ppk20/fictional modern bizon
- Molot (Vepr "Molot" IPSC) - have kinda cool customization and cool drum
- AR-15 (M4A1) - has some ar15 customization write all variants here later pls
- AW Sniper (AI AWM) - has some cool stocks and calibers
- Deagle (IMI Desert Eagle) - have lots of custom parts, mw22 inspired
- PDW-7 (HK MP7) - not so many atts, you can make it small
- MRD57 (FN Five-seveN Mk3 MRD) - only big magazine, auto trigger and skins as customization

There might be second pack in future (or i'll just add guns to this one slowly, i'm not sure)

Might need some more addons for sounds! like this for example https://github.com/Arnau-Morant/ArcCW-UnnamedProject

Assets are based off TastyTony and KaanArsenal models (some guns and attachments made by meee :3)
Animations are stolen from Partexedd's UnnamedProject, additional anims by mee (partex your animlations are great <3 !!)

Big thanks to Moka for writing lua for all guns and most atts, i wouldn't be able to finish this pack without him
Thanks to Cylo for little help and testing

Sound design is worst part of this pack, i have no idea where to take sfx from!! plese help
