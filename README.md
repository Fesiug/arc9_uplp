# PolyArms Project
The PolyArms Project (will be named like this if i won't find any better name until release)
  
Very WIP!!!  

The PolyArms Project (might be renamed) is a GMod weapon project focusing on bringing enjoyable and detailed weapons using the ARC9 weapon base into your hands. The unique part? The low poly appearance.

Currently includes 9 weapons:
- Assault Rifle: AK - Based off of the AK-103, this rifle can be customized to resemble many various AK variants.
- Assault Rifle: AK-12 - Based off of the 2023 AK-12M1, this rifle can be turned into the various eras of the modern AK-12.
- Assault Rifle: AR-15 - Based off of the Colt M4A1, this rifle platform can be turned into various AR-15-based weapons, and be turned into a submachine gun chambered in either 9x19mm or .45 ACP.

- Submachine Gun: AK SMG - Based off of the PP-19-01 "Vityaz", this platform can be customized into the PP-19 "Bizon" or the more modern PPK-20.
- Submachine Gun: PDW-7 - Based off of the H&K MP7, this classic machine pistol makes up for its lacking unique attachments with its iconic status.

- Shotgun: Molot - Based off of the Vepr "Molot" IPSC, this semi-automatic beast can utilize various 12-gauge shells and has plenty of customization to boot.

- Sniper: AW Sniper - Based off of the AI AWP, this rifle can be converted into various AI rifles, or into a lightweight sporting rifle.

- Handgun: Deagle - Based off of the IMI Desert Eagle, this hand cannon packs a huge punch at the cost of inverting your wrist after every shot.
- Handgun: MRD57 - Based off of the FN Five-SeveN Mk3 MRD, this handgun lacks unique attachments but still packs a decent punch.

There might be a second pack coming in the future, or more weapons might be added to this pack.

You might require this addon for various sounds:
https://github.com/Arnau-Morant/ArcCW-UnnamedProject

Assets are based off of TastyTony and KaanArsenal models with some guns and attachments made by Darsu.
Animations are ripped from Partexedd's UnnamedProject while additional animations are made by Darsu ( partex, your animations are amazing <3 !! ).

Huge thanks to Moka for helping to write the LUA for all the weapons and most attachments, and also including localizations. The pack would not be finished without him.
Additionally, thanks to Cylo for helping a bit and also testing the addon.

Sound design is this addon's current weakest link. It will be updated going forward to release.
