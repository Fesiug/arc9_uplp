# PolyArms Project
The PolyArms Project (might rename idk) is a pack with bunch of cool stylish low poly weapons :p  
I'm making this pack purely for myself and my friends to play and have fun with so there's lots of attachments and guns of my personal taste. If you don't like colors/names/style/animations/variety of guns feel free to skip it

Huge thanks to Moka for helping to write lua for guns and atts and swedish loc (i don't think swedish people know about computers and garysmod but whatever). I wouldn't be able to finish (or, atleast make playable) this pack without him  
Thanks to Cylo for little helps and testing =3
