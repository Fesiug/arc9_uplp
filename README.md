There might be second pack in future (or i'll just add guns to this one slowly, i'm not sure)

In current state might require this addon for sounds - https://github.com/Arnau-Morant/ArcCW-UnnamedProject

Assets are based off TastyTony and KaanArsenal models (some guns and attachments made by meee :3)  
Animations are stolen from Partexedd's UnnamedProject, additional anims by mee (partex your animlations are great <3 !!)

Huge thanks to Moka for helping to write lua for guns and atts and swedish loc (i don't think swedish people know about computers and garysmod but whatever). I wouldn't be able to finish (or, atleast make playable) this pack without him  
Thanks to Cylo for little helps and testing =3

Sounds are ass rn i hope rzenith will fix that :-)
