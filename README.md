I'm making this pack purely for myself and my friends to have fun with so there's lots of attachments and guns of my personal taste! (not taking any suggestions or ideas) 

Assets are based off **TastyTony** and **KaanArsenal** models (some guns and attachments made by meee :3)  
Animations taken from **Partexedd** unreleased arccw gun project (his animations are great <3), additional anims by mee  
All sounds by **rzen1th** <sub>(stolen with permission from Urban Decay and Renewal and other UC guns)</sub>, some sounds are made specifically for this mod!

Huge thanks to **Moka** for helping to write lua for guns and atts and swedish loc <sub>(i don't think swedish people know about computers and garysmod but whatever)</sub>. I wouldn't be able to finish (or, atleast make playable) this pack without him  
Thanks to **Cylo** for little helps and testing =3
