## The PolyArms Project is a pack with bunch of fun and stylish low poly weapons!
Visit workshop page for actual current description https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3098824960

I'm making this pack purely for myself and my friends to have fun with so there's lots of attachments and guns of my personal taste! (not taking any suggestions or ideas) 

Thanks to:
- TastyTony and KaanArsenal for gun models this pack is based on
- Partexedd for those gorgeous animations
- rzen1th for gun sounds (used with permission from Urban Coalition mods, some are custom made for this pack)
- Moka for code structure, weapons and attachments lua
- 8Z for balancing this out and additional features
- Cylo for little helps and testing
- Me for additional animations, modelling & kitbashing and for rest of stuff here :3
